Summary generated Thu Jan  5 01:15:31 AM CET 2023 for
point-symmetry group triclinic_1bar, polar tensor of rank 5.
================================================================================
Symmetry operations associated with 1 (triclinic, inversion symmetry for all
axes) are:

1. IDENTITY OPERATION WITH INVERSION APPLIED ALONG XYZ AXIS
I (identity operation with inversion applied along xyz axis), described by R(I)
for which det(R(I)) = -1 (being a improper rotation):
⎡-1  0   0 ⎤
⎢          ⎥
⎢0   -1  0 ⎥
⎢          ⎥
⎣0   0   -1⎦

Compiling equation system from the 1 symmetries of point-symmetry group 1
(triclinic, inversion symmetry for all axes).
Solving system of 243 equations for nonzero elements.

POINT SYMMETRY GROUP 1 (TRICLINIC, INVERSION SYMMETRY FOR ALL AXES)

For the polar (true) tensor of rank 5 (for which there in a completely non-
symmetrical case would be a maximum of 243 elements) under constraint of point-
symmetry group 1 (triclinic, inversion symmetry for all axes), there are 0
nonzero elements, of which 0 are independent.
