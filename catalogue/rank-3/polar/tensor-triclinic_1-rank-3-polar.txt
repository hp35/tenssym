================================================================================
Symmetry operations associated with 1 (triclinic, no inversion symmetry) are:

1. IDENTITY OPERATION
I (identity operation), described by R(I) for which det(R(I)) = 1 (being a
proper rotation):
⎡1  0  0⎤
⎢       ⎥
⎢0  1  0⎥
⎢       ⎥
⎣0  0  1⎦

Compiling equation system from the 1 symmetries of point-symmetry group 1
(triclinic, no inversion symmetry).
No linearly independent equations found from system.

POINT SYMMETRY GROUP 1 (TRICLINIC, NO INVERSION SYMMETRY)

For the polar (true) tensor of rank 3 (for which there in a completely non-
symmetrical case would be a maximum of 27 elements) under constraint of point-
symmetry group 1 (triclinic, no inversion symmetry), there are 27 nonzero
elements, of which 27 are independent.

The 27 independent and nonzero tensor elements are as follows:
       1.  xxx = independent
       2.  xxy = independent
       3.  xxz = independent
       4.  xyx = independent
       5.  xyy = independent
       6.  xyz = independent
       7.  xzx = independent
       8.  xzy = independent
       9.  xzz = independent
      10.  yxx = independent
      11.  yxy = independent
      12.  yxz = independent
      13.  yyx = independent
      14.  yyy = independent
      15.  yyz = independent
      16.  yzx = independent
      17.  yzy = independent
      18.  yzz = independent
      19.  zxx = independent
      20.  zxy = independent
      21.  zxz = independent
      22.  zyx = independent
      23.  zyy = independent
      24.  zyz = independent
      25.  zzx = independent
      26.  zzy = independent
      27.  zzz = independent
