POINT SYMMETRY GROUP 1 (TRICLINIC, INVERSION SYMMETRY FOR ALL AXES)

For the polar (true) tensor of rank 4 (for which there in a completely non-
symmetrical case would be a maximum of 81 elements) under constraint of point-
symmetry group 1 (triclinic, inversion symmetry for all axes), there are 81
nonzero elements, of which 81 are independent.

The 81 independent and nonzero tensor elements are as follows:
