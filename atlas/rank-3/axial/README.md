# Nonzero elements of rank-3 axial tensors

The following compilation of nonzero elements of polar (true) and axial (pseudo) rank-3 tensor elements was  generated using the TensSym package (https://github.com/hp35/tenssym/).

The summaries of non-zero and independent elements of the axial tensors of rank 3 are available for the following point-symmetry groups:
- Group cubic_4bar3m: [tensor-cubic_4bar3m-rank3-axial.txt](tensor-cubic_4bar3m-rank3-axial.txt)
- Group cubic_23: [tensor-cubic_23-rank3-axial.txt](tensor-cubic_23-rank3-axial.txt)

See https://github.com/hp35/tenssym for details and code for the implementation of the TensSym package, and https://github.com/hp35/tenssym/tree/main/atlas/ for the complete atlas of nonzero and independent elements of other ranks.
