POINT SYMMETRY GROUP 23 (CUBIC, NO INVERSION SYMMETRY)

For the polar (true) tensor of rank 3 (for which there in a completely non-
symmetrical case would be a maximum of 27 elements) under constraint of point-
symmetry group 23 (cubic, no inversion symmetry), there are 6 nonzero elements,
of which 2 are independent.

The 2 independent and nonzero tensor elements are as follows:
       1.  xyz = yzx = zxy
       2.  xzy = yxz = zyx
