POINT SYMMETRY GROUP 432 (CUBIC, NO INVERSION SYMMETRY)

For the polar (true) tensor of rank 3 (for which there in a completely non-
symmetrical case would be a maximum of 27 elements) under constraint of point-
symmetry group 432 (cubic, no inversion symmetry), there are 6 nonzero elements,
of which 1 are independent.

The 1 independent and nonzero tensor elements are as follows:
       1.  xyz = yzx = zxy = -xzy = -yxz = -zyx
