POINT SYMMETRY GROUP M3M (CUBIC, INVERSION SYMMETRY)

For the polar (true) tensor of rank 5 (for which there in a completely non-
symmetrical case would be a maximum of 243 elements) under constraint of point-
symmetry group m3m (cubic, inversion symmetry), there are 0 nonzero elements, of
which 0 are independent.
