POINT SYMMETRY GROUP 422 (TETRAGONAL, NO INVERSION SYMMETRY)

For the axial (pseudo) tensor of rank 2 (for which there in a completely non-
symmetrical case would be a maximum of 9 elements) under constraint of point-
symmetry group 422 (tetragonal, no inversion symmetry), there are 3 nonzero
elements, of which 2 are independent.

The 2 independent and nonzero tensor elements are as follows:
       1.  xx = yy
       2.  zz = independent
